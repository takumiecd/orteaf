/**
 * @brief Weak-only control block with handle/payload/pool binding.
 *
 * This control block tracks only weak references and does not own the payload.
 * It is intended for resources whose lifetime is managed externally (system-
 * or device-owned objects). The control block can still safely expose access
 * metadata (handle/pointer/pool) and validate that weak references remain.
 *
 * Payload binding is explicit and can only occur when no references exist.
 * The control block does not create/destroy payloads directly and does not
 * release payloads on weak count transition; it only tracks weak lifetime.
 *
 * Thread-safety: reference counts use atomics. Payload binding methods are not
 * synchronized and must be externally serialized.
 *
 * @tparam HandleT Handle type with Handle::invalid() and isValid().
 * @tparam PayloadT Payload type stored in the pool.
 * @tparam PoolT Pool type providing release(handle) -> bool (unused here).
